# Welcome to the lockable documentation

[Lockable](https://lockable.dev) is a service providing synchronization locking for distributed systems. Think of it as `flock` but for distributed systems.

See common [Use Cases](use-cases.md) for Lockable.

You can use Lockable directly via [HTTPS requests](https-endpoints.md) or via the [Python client](python-client.md)
